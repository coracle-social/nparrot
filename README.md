`nparrot-chat` (_"Nostr Parrot Chat"_) is a convenient CLI tool that facilitates messaging over Nostr relay chat rooms.

NB: This project is a fork of [nparrot](https://github.com/Leaf-Computer/nparrot) by Daniel D'Aquino.

This tool has a few use cases and benefits:
- ü§ñ Talk to your [Goose AI agent](https://block.github.io/goose/) via chat by using any Nostr client compatible [relays as groups](https://habla.news/u/hodlbod@coracle.social/1741286140797).
- üîó Easily integrate almost any other command line tool with Nostr chat messages (be careful about letting other people have access).

Here are the features it includes:
- ‚úÖ **`send` command:** Sends a NIP-C7 message using specified arguments, or from stdin.
- ‚úÖ **`wait` command:** Listens and waits for the next NIP-C7 message from a specific room, and prints it to stdout once received.
- ‚úÖ **`onmessage` command:** Continuously listens for NIP-C7 messages, and for each one, it runs a shell command you specify.
- ‚úÖ **`listen` command:** Continuously listens for NIP-C7 messages, and for each one, it prints it to stdout.
- ‚úÖ **`mcp` command:** MCP server that allows an AI agent to send a message to a specific user, or to wait for their message.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This is relatively new, experimental software. Please proceed with caution.

# Installation

We currently don't provide pre-built binaries. If you'd like a pre-built binary, please open an issue or contact us, we can help! Otherwise, please follow the build instructions below.

Make sure you have `cargo` 1.85 or higher installed. Then run:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

Then, you can find the executable binary on `./target/release/nparrot-chat`, which you can run from there, or you can move it to another more convenient directory such as `~/.local/bin`.

# Talking to a goose AI agent via Nostr DMs

A very cool use case for this tool is the ability to talk to a [goose AI agent](https://block.github.io/goose/) chat.

NOTE: this isn't recommended unless you fully trust everyone who has access to the room `nparrot-chat` is listening on. Goose is an _agent_, which means it can read and write files on your computer.

1. Copy `.env.template` to `.env`
2. Download any Nostr client that supports NIP-C7 chat messages (e.g. [Flotilla](https://flotilla.social)).
3. Go through onboarding, and join a space. Add the space url to `.env` as `RELAY`.
4. Find the room you'd like your bot to join and get the value of its `h` tag. Add this to `.env` as `ROOM`.
5. Generate a nostr private key (nsec) for your AI agent. If you have [`nak`](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nak), this can be done by simply running:
```
nak key generate | nak encode nsec
```
6. Take note of the `nsec` generated in the previous step and add it to `.env.` as `NSEC`.
7. **Optional but recommended:** Send a message to test if the setup works.
```
nparrot-chat send "test"
```
8. **Optional but recommended:** Modify your `.goosehints` file, to help the AI agent do the right thing.
9. Finally, run this command to start:
```
nparrot-chat onmessage 'goose run --with-extension "nparrot-chat mcp" -i -'
```
10. Try sending a message from your app, and see your AI agent respond to it!

Notes:
- During testing, gpt-4o was used with good results
